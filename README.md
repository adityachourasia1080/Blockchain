# Blockchain

Created an decentralised network using Blockchain as Underlying Technology.Every block Consisit of Transactions which was mined by the Miners By doing Proof of Work startegy. Functions were Implemented to Handle the Longest chain rule of Blockchain . Blocks are Crytographically linked using SHA256 cryto Algorithm. For making Decentralised, Introduced Different Nodes in Network Who all maintain an copy of Blockchain. Flask Framework is used for implementation.Api Testing is Done in Postman. Coding is Done in Python
